#
# Useful script for taking screen shots from an Android device which I then need to send
# to other people, or include in a bug report.
#
# This script takes a "keyword" argument (intended to be a description of the screenshot
# you're taking), runs a command to take the screenshot, and saves the resulting PNG file
# in a directory under your "~/www" directory (see SCREENSHOTPATH below) with a filename
# based on the current date/time and the specified keyword.
#
# It also prints out a URL (under www.corp.google.com) that other people on the corp
# network can use to view that screenshot.  (Note 1: This will only work if your
# screenshot directory is world-readable.  Note 2: After writing a screenshot file, it can
# take a minute or so before www.corp can see it.)

# Ok, capture the screenshot...

# Approach #1: Depends on having a "screenshot2" executable, but works on all platforms.
#
# Note you need to have the "screenshot2" shell script in your path.
# (As of late 2012 / early 2013, you can run "m screenshot2" in a master tree
# to build it.  As of March 2013, it's in prebuilts/devtools/tools in master.)

#screenshot2 $SCREENSHOTPATH

#
# Approach #2: doesn't require the "screenshot2" host tool, but depends on
# "adb shell screencap" which is only ICS(?) and later.
#
#   adb shell screencap -p | sed 's/\r$//' > $SCREENSHOTPATH
#
# Or, if the line endings cause trouble and the above "sed" command doesn't help,
# just do:
$ADB shell screencap -p /sdcard/screen.png
$ADB pull /sdcard/screen.png $SCREENSHOTPATH
#

# umask seems to default to 0027 under Goobuntu, so need to manually make the file
# world-readable (so that the www.corp web server can read it.)  Note that SCREENSHOTDIR
# itself must also be world-readable so that the www.corp web server can read its files.
